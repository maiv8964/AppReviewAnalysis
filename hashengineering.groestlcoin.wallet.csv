exodusmovement.exodus,Jurijs Kastanovs,"Great wallet, but would really love some more web3 capabilities in it and cheaper swaps.

But connecting to many dapps is still impossible (as mentioned above with some token staking). Also burner subwallets is something to be added. Thanks!",4

At first, it was a simple easy wallet to use to store multiple types of cryptocurrency, while keeping your local private keys safe. Then they introduce their swapping feature. The minimum amount of exchange is ridiculous, as you have to have a lot of crypto in order to change it into another. You got to have over $100 in order to exchange certain circumstances.

There are other much better wallets with a much lower minimum value for swapc oins (about 10 dollars instead of 150,000 as Exodus). I'm very disappointed with Exodus wallet.",1
